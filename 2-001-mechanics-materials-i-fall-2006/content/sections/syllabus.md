Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Structure
----------------

### Lectures

Each week there will be two lectures. Attendance at lectures is mandatory.

### Recitations

Each week, students will meet for a 1.5-hour recitation section consisting of 10 - 20 students. Attendance during these sessions is **mandatory**. The recitation sections will consist of additional discussion of course material, examples and experiments. These sections serve three main purposes: (1) they provide a more informal opportunity to explore issues and ask questions about lectures, texts, or previously assigned material which requires clarification; (2) example problems will be presented and discussed, and (3) they provide opportunities to further explore course topics with experiments.

Prerequisites and Corequisites
------------------------------

Prerequisites:

*   _8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics_
*   [_18.02 Multivariable Calculus_](/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010)

Corequisites:

*   [_18.03 Differential Equations_](/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011)

Prerequisites and Corequisites are strictly enforced.

Texts
-----

### Required

1.  Hibbeler, R. C. _Mechanics of Materials_. 6th ed. East Rutherford, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2004. ISBN: 9780131913455.
2.  [Lecture Notes]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/lecture-notes)

### Recommended

3.  Crandall, S. H., N. C. Dahl, and T. J. Lardner. _An Introduction to the Mechanics of Solids_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 1979. ISBN: 9780070662308.

Assignments
-----------

Problem sets will typically be handed out on Wednesdays and due the following Wednesday. To receive credit, problem sets must be handed in at the beginning of class on the due date. Problem sets will not necessarily be assigned every week because of tests, holidays, etc. **Late problem sets will not be accepted. The lowest problem set grade will be dropped**.

You are welcome, and encouraged, to work on the assignment problems with fellow students. A good way to learn the material is in small study groups. Such groups work best if members have attempted the problems individually before meeting as a group. Of course, the assignment solution that you turn in should reflect your own understanding, and not that of your fellow students. In other words, do not copy directly from other students. If it is obvious that such direct copying has occurred, we will disallow that homework.

Tests
-----

There will be two one and one-half hour quizzes and a three-hour final exam. These will be closed book. Two pages of notes (one-sided) are permitted for each quiz, four pages for the final.

Tutorials
---------

The TAs will hold a tutorial session one or two days before each quiz. Details will be announced prior to each tutorial.
